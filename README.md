# NPChan Translate
Help us translate NPChan.

NPChan needs your help in translating NPChan to your language. NPChan aims to provide uncensored internet to all Nepalese people and you can help us make it better.

## Never Asked Questions
### How can you help?
You can help us by submitting Pull request to add new language or submit an issue. You can also help us improve our existing translation.

### How will I be rewarded?
NPChan features the name or username of contributers on NPChan's [About Us](https://npchan.com/about/) page (only if you mentioned to include your name on Issues or Pull Request)

### I don't know Json but I want to contribute? Is there any hack?
Yes, copy the contents on **English.json** or download the repository as zip file. Create new file Named "YourLanguage.json" and open on a plain text editor or any text editor (Notepad, Notepad++, Sublime Text, Atom, Brackets or whatever your fav. text editor is) and copy-paste the contents on **English.json** on there. Here is a demo portion of language file you want to translate:
```json
{
	"basic": {
    	"home": "Home Page",
        "search": "Search"
}
```
You can translate that to:
```json
{
	"basic": {
    	"home": "गृहपृष्ठ",
        "search": "खोज्नुहोस्"
}
```

>Please make sure that you don't alter the contents on "left": "side" only.
